If you want to run this with an Oracle database, you have to inject the Oracle JDBC driver yourself. But how can you ensure that you automatically always will have the most recent OJDBC driver in your Confluence image?&nbsp;\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-docker\"><code>FROM atlassian/confluence:8.5.15-ubuntu-jdk17\n\n# Download the ojdbc driver\nRUN curl -fSL \"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/oracle/database/jdbc/ojdbc10/19.23.0.0/ojdbc10-19.23.0.0.jar\" \\\n    -o \"${CONFLUENCE_INSTALL_DIR}/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/ojdbc10.jar\"\n\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    First of all, let's extract the semantic version tag from the URL into a separate ARG so that Renovate only needs to bump the version there:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-docker\"><code>FROM atlassian/confluence:8.5.15-ubuntu-jdk17\n\nARG OJDBC_VERSION=19.24.0.0\n\n# Download the ojdbc driver\nRUN curl -fSL \"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/oracle/database/jdbc/ojdbc10/${OJDBC_VERSION}/ojdbc10-${OJDBC_VERSION}.jar\" \\\n    -o \"${CONFLUENCE_INSTALL_DIR}/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/ojdbc10.jar\"\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Next, we will add a comment directly above the ARG OJDBC version, which we will later use to tell Renovate what dependency type and package this version tag is about. It's a maven package with the package name \"com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc10\":\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-docker\"><code>FROM atlassian/confluence:8.5.15-ubuntu-jdk17\n\n# renovate: datasource=maven depName=com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc10 packageName=com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc10\nARG OJDBC_VERSION=19.24.0.0\n\n# Download the ojdbc driver\nRUN curl -fSL \"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/oracle/database/jdbc/ojdbc10/${OJDBC_VERSION}/ojdbc10-${OJDBC_VERSION}.jar\" \\\n    -o \"${CONFLUENCE_INSTALL_DIR}/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/ojdbc10.jar\"</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    You could write a custom regex manager in the Renovate config that updates this version tag. But what if you have multiple ARG or ENV version tags in multiple Dockerfiles within the same repo? You Probably don't want to write a regex config for each case.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's imagine you have something like this in your Dockerfile:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-docker\"><code># renovate: datasource=github-tags depName=node packageName=nodejs/node versioning=node\nENV NODE_VERSION=20.10.0\n# renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=composer packageName=composer/composer\nENV COMPOSER_VERSION=1.9.3\n# renovate: datasource=docker packageName=docker versioning=docker\nENV DOCKER_VERSION=19.03.1\n# renovate: datasource=npm packageName=yarn\nENV YARN_VERSION=1.19.1</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    All you now need is the following regex configuration in your <em>renovate.json</em> config to detect and bump all of these version tags:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-json\"><code>{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\",\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"config:recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"separateMinorPatch\": true,\n  \"customManagers\": [\n    {\n      \"customType\": \"regex\",\n      \"description\": \"Update _VERSION variables in Dockerfiles\",\n      \"fileMatch\": [\"(^|/|\\\\.)Dockerfile$\", \"(^|/)Dockerfile\\\\.[^/]*$\"],\n      \"matchStrings\": [\n        \"# renovate: datasource=(?&lt;datasource&gt;[a-z-]+?)(?: depName=(?&lt;depName&gt;.+?))? packageName=(?&lt;packageName&gt;.+?)(?: versioning=(?&lt;versioning&gt;[a-z-]+?))?\\\\s(?:ENV|ARG) .+?_VERSION=(?&lt;currentValue&gt;.+?)\\\\s\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, you could even set up auto merge for these Renovate updates. Make sure you have some merge checks before you enable this. At least you should ensure that the Docker image can still be built before a new Renovate pull request gets auto-merged.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    ✨ Happy renovating!&nbsp;✨\n  </p>",

Let's review each one.\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Settings Sync: You can synchronize your Visual Studio Code (VS Code) settings between the desktop application and the VS Code web client.</li><li>Dotfiles: You can use a dotfiles repository to specify scripts, shell preferences, and other configurations.<br></li><li>    Rename a Codespace: When you create a Codespace, it's assigned an autogenerated display name. If you have multiple Codespaces, the display name helps you to differentiate between Codespaces. You can change the display name for your Codespace.<br></li><li>    Change your shell: You can change your shell in a Codespace to keep the setup you're used to. When you're working in a Codespace, you can open a new terminal window with a shell of your choice, change your default shell for new terminal windows, or install a new shell. You can also use dotfiles to configure your shell.<br></li><li>    Change the machine type: You can change the type of machine that's running your Codespace, so that you're using resources appropriate for the work you're doing.<br></li><li>    Set the default editor: You can set your default editor for Codespaces in your personal settings page. Set your editor preference so that when you create a Codespace or open an existing Codespace, it opens to your default editor.<br>- Visual Studio Code (desktop application)<br>- Visual Studio Code (web client application)<br>- JetBrains Gateway - for opening Codespaces in a JetBrains IDE<br>- JupyterLab - the web interface for Project Jupyter<br></li><li>    Set the default region: You can set your default region in the GitHub Codespaces profile settings page to personalize where your data is held.<br></li><li>    Set the timeout: A Codespace will stop running after a period of inactivity. By default this period is 30 minutes, but you can specify a longer or shorter default timeout period in your personal settings on GitHub. The updated setting applies to any new Codespaces you create, or to existing Codespaces the next time you start them.</li><li>Configure automatic deletion: Inactive Codespaces are automatically deleted. You can choose how long your stopped Codespaces are retained, up to a maximum of 30 days.<br></li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <h2 id=\"difference-betweenandnbspcodespaces-and-githubdev-editor\">\n      Difference between&nbsp;Codespaces and GitHub.dev editor\n    </h2>\n\n    <h4 id=\"when-should-i-use-github-codespaces-and-when-should-i-use-githubdev\">\n      when should I use GitHub Codespaces and when should I use GitHub.dev?\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    GitHub.dev is a good fit if you only want to navigate some files and sources code repositories from GitHub, and maybe make and commit small code changes.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    On the other hand, if you want to run a bunch of tests with your code, or build a heavy application you better use GitHub Codespaces.

It is an alternative to REST, SOAP, or gRPC. In the next Part we will query the details for a specific book from an online store backend.<br><br>This is an example request you can send to a GraphQL server to retrieve book details:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-graphql\"><code>query bookDetails {\n  bookById(id: \"book-1\") {\n    id\n    name\n    pageCount\n    author {\n      firstName\n      lastName\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    This GraphQL request says:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>perform a query for a book with id \"book-1\"</li><li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: 1em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">for the book, return id, name, pageCount and author</span><br></li><li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: 1em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">for the author, return firstName and lastName</span><br></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    The response is in JSON. For example:<br>\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-json\"><code>{\n  \"bookById\": {\n    \"id\":\"book-1\",\n    \"name\":\"Effective Java\",\n    \"pageCount\":416,\n    \"author\": {\n      \"firstName\":\"Joshua\",\n      \"lastName\":\"Bloch\"\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    An important feature of GraphQL is that it defines a schema language, and that it is statically typed. The server knows exactly what types of objects requests can query and what fields those objects contain. Furthermore, clients can introspect the server to ask for schema details.\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    The word schema in this Post refers to a \"GraphQL Schema\", which is not related to other schemas like \"JSON Schema\" or \"Database Schema\".\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The schema for the above query is:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-graphql\"><code>type Query {\n    bookById(id: ID): Book\n}\n\ntype Book {\n    id: ID\n    name: String\n    pageCount: Int\n    author: Author\n}\n\ntype Author {\n    id: ID\n    firstName: String\n    lastName: String\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    This Post will focus on how to implement a GraphQL server with this schema in Java.<br><br>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with GraphQL. Further information can be found on the official GraphQL page.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"our-example-api-getting-book-details\">\n      Our example API: getting book details\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    These are the main steps to create a server with Spring for GraphQL:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Define a GraphQL schema</li><li>Implement the logic to fetch the actual data for a query<br></li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    Our example app will be a simple API to get details for a specific book. It is not intended to be a comprehensive API.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"schema\">\n      Schema\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    In your Spring for GraphQL application prepared earlier, add a new file <em>schema.graphqls</em> to the <em>src/main/resources/graphql</em> folder with the following content:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-graphql\"><code>type Query {\n    bookById(id: ID): Book\n}\n\ntype Book {\n    id: ID\n    name: String\n    pageCount: Int\n    author: Author\n}\n\ntype Author {\n    id: ID\n    firstName: String\n    lastName: String\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Every GraphQL schema has a top-level <em>Query</em> type, and the fields under it are the query operations exposed by the application. Here the schema defines one query called <em>bookById</em> that returns the details of a specific book.<br><br>It also defines the types <em>Book</em> with fields<em> id, name, pageCount</em> and <em>author</em>, and the type <em>Author</em> with fields <em>firstName</em> and <em>lastName</em>.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    The Domain Specific Language used above to describe a schema is called the Schema Definition Language or SDL. For more details, see the GraphQL documentation.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"source-of-the-data\">\n      Source of the data\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    A key strength of GraphQL is that data can be sourced from anywhere. Data can come from a database, an external service, or a static in-memory list.<br><br>To simplify the demo here, book and author data will come from static lists inside their respective classes.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"create-the-book-and-author-data-sources\">\n      Create the Book and Author data sources\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Let’s now create the <em>Book</em> and <em>Author</em> classes in the main application package, right next to <em>GraphQlServerApplication</em>. Use the following as their content:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-java\"><code>package com.example.graphqlserver;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic record Book (String id, String name, int pageCount, String authorId) {\n\n    private static List&lt;Book&gt; books = Arrays.asList(\n            new Book(\"book-1\", \"Effective Java\", 416, \"author-1\"),\n            new Book(\"book-2\", \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", 208, \"author-2\"),\n            new Book(\"book-3\", \"Down Under\", 436, \"author-3\")\n    );\n\n    public static Book getById(String id) {\n        return books.stream()\n\t\t\t\t.filter(book -&gt; book.id().equals(id))\n\t\t\t\t.findFirst()\n\t\t\t\t.orElse(null);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<pre class=\" language-java\"><code>package com.example.graphqlserver;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic record Author (String id, String firstName, String lastName) {\n\n    private static List&lt;Author&gt; authors = Arrays.asList(\n            new Author(\"author-1\", \"Joshua\", \"Bloch\"),\n            new Author(\"author-2\", \"Douglas\", \"Adams\"),\n            new Author(\"author-3\", \"Bill\", \"Bryson\")\n    );\n\n    public static Author getById(String id) {\n        return authors.stream()\n\t\t\t\t.filter(author -&gt; author.id().equals(id))\n\t\t\t\t.findFirst()\n\t\t\t\t.orElse(null);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"adding-code-to-fetch-data\">\n      Adding code to fetch data\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Spring for GraphQL provides an annotation-based programming model. With controller annotated methods, we can declare how to fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields.<br><br>Add the following to <em>BookController.java</em> in the main application package, next to Book and Author:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-java\"><code>package com.example.graphqlserver;\n\nimport org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.Argument;\nimport org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping;\nimport org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.SchemaMapping;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\n\n@Controller\npublic class BookController {\n    @QueryMapping\n    public Book bookById(@Argument String id) {\n        return Book.getById(id);\n    }\n\n    @SchemaMapping\n    public Author author(Book book) {\n        return Author.getById(book.authorId());\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    By defining a method named <em>bookById</em> annotated with <em>@QuerMapping</em>, this controller declares how to fetch a <em>Book</em> as defined under the Query type. The query field is determined from the method name, but can also be declared on the annotation itself.\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    Spring for GraphQL uses RuntimeWiring.Builder that registers each such controller method as a GraphQL Java graphql.schema.DataFetcher. A DataFetcher provides the logic to fetch the data for a query or for any schema field. The Spring Boot starter for GraphQL has auto-configurations that automates this registration.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In the GraphQL Java engine, <em>DataFetchingEnvironment</em> provides access to a map of field-specific argument values. Use the <em>@Argument</em> annotation to have an argument bound to a target object and injected into the controller method. By default, the method parameter name is used to look up the argument, but can also be specified on the annotation itself.<br><br>This <em>bookById</em> method defines how to get a specific <em>Book</em>, but does not take care of fetching the related <em>Author</em>. If the request asks for the author information, GraphQL Java will need to fetch this field.<br><br>The <em>@SchemaMapping</em> annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema and declares it to be the <em>DataFetcher</em> for that field. The field name defaults to the method name, and the type name defaults to the simple class name of the source/parent object injected into the method. In this example, the field defaults to <em>author</em> and the type defaults to <em>Book</em>.<br><br>For more, see the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/reference/controllers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">documentation for the Spring for GraphQL annotated controller feature</a>.<br><br>Now let’s run our first query.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"running-our-first-query\">\n      Running our first query\n    </h2>\n\n    <h3 id=\"enable-the-graphiql-playground\">\n      Enable the GraphiQL Playground\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    GraphiQL is a useful visual interface for writing and executing queries, and much more.

With the help of Spring for GraphQL, you were able to achieve this with only a few lines of code.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"testing\">\n      Testing\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Spring for GraphQL provides helpers for GraphQL testing in the <em>spring-graphql-test</em> artifact. We have already included this artifact as part of the project generated by Spring Initializr.<br><br>Thoroughly testing a GraphQL service requires tests with different scopes. In this tutorial, we will write a <em>@GraphQlTest</em> slice test, which focuses on a single controller. There are other helpers to assist with full end-to-end integration tests and focused server side tests. For the full details, see the Spring for GraphQL Testing documentation and Auto-configured Spring for GraphQL tests in the Spring Boot documentation.<br><br>Let’s write a controller slice test that verifies the same <em>bookDetails</em> query requested in the GraphiQL playground a few moments ago.<br><br>Add the following to a test file <em>BookControllerTests.java</em>. Save this file in a location within the <em>src/test/java/com/example/graphqlserver/</em> folder.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-java\"><code>package com.example.graphqlserver;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.graphql.GraphQlTest;\nimport org.springframework.graphql.test.tester.GraphQlTester;\n\n@GraphQlTest(BookController.class)\npublic class BookControllerTests {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private GraphQlTester graphQlTester;\n\n    @Test\n    void shouldGetFirstBook() {\n        this.graphQlTester\n\t\t\t\t.documentName(\"bookDetails\")\n\t\t\t\t.variable(\"id\", \"book-1\")\n                .execute()\n                .path(\"bookById\")\n                .matchesJson(\"\"\"\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"book-1\",\n                        \"name\": \"Effective Java\",\n                        \"pageCount\": 416,\n                        \"author\": {\n                          \"firstName\": \"Joshua\",\n                          \"lastName\": \"Bloch\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                \"\"\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    This test refers to a GraphQL query similar to what we used in the GraphiQL Playground. It’s parameterized with an <em>$id</em> to make it reusable. Add this query in a <em>bookDetails</em>.<em>graphql</em> file located in <em>src/test/resources/graphql-test.</em>\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-graphql\"><code>query bookDetails($id: ID) {\n    bookById(id: $id) {\n        id\n        name\n        pageCount\n        author {\n            id\n            firstName\n            lastName\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Run the test and verify that the result is identical to the GraphQL query manually requested in the GraphiQL Playground.<br><br>The <em>@GraphQlTest</em> annotation is useful for writing controller slice tests, which are focused on a single controller. <em>@GraphQlTest </em>auto-configures the Spring for GraphQL infrastructure, without any transport nor server being involved. Automatic configuration enables us to write tests faster by skipping boilerplate code. As this is a focused slice test, only a limited number of beans are scanned including <em>@Controller</em> and <em>RuntimeWiringConfigurer.</em><br><br><em>GraphQlTester</em> is a contract that declares a common workflow for testing GraphQL requests, independent of transport. In our test, we provide a document with <em>documentName</em> with the required variables, then <em>execute</em> the request. We then select a part of the response with its JSON path and assert that the JSON at this location matches the expected result.<br><br>Congratulations! In this tutorial you built a GraphQL service, ran your first query, and wrote your first GraphQL test!<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

See how the third directory /var/www/html remains in the stack as the first two directories swap positions:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs\n/etc/apache2 ~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html\n$ pushd\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src /etc/apache2 /var/www/html\n$ pushd\n/etc/apache2 ~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html\n$ pushd\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src /etc/apache2 /var/www/html</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    <em>pushd</em> behaves similarly to the <em>cd -</em> command, toggling between two directories, but it does not have the limitation of remembering just one directory.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"turn-a-mistaken-cd-into-a-pushd\">\n      Turn a mistaken cd into a pushd\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Suppose you are jumping among several directories with pushd and you accidentally run cd instead and lose a directory:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html /etc/apache2\n$ cd /etc/ssl/certs\n$ dirs\n/etc/ssl/certs /var/www/html /etc/apache2</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Oops, the accidental cd command replaced ~/Work/Projects/Web/src in the stack with /etc/ssl/certs. But don’t worry. You can add the missing directory back to the stack without typing its long path. Just run <em>pushd</em> twice, once with a dash argument and once without:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ pushd -\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src /etc/ssl/certs /var/www/html\n/etc/apache2\n$ pushd\n/etc/ssl/certs ~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html\n/etc/apache2</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Why this works:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>The first pushd returns to your shell’s previous directory, ~/Work/Projects/Web/src, and pushes it onto the stack. pushd, like cd, accepts a dash as an argument to mean “go back to my previous directory.”</li><li>The second pushd command swaps the top two directories, bringing you back to /etc/ssl/certs. The end result is that you’ve restored ~/Work/Projects/Web/src to the second position in the stack, exactly where it would have been if you hadn’t made your mistake.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <h3 id=\"go-deeper-into-the-stack\">\n      Go deeper into the stack\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    What if you want to cd between directories in the stack other than the top two? <em>pushd</em> and <em>popd</em> accept a positive or negative integer argument to operate further into the stack. The command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ pushd +N</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    shifts N directories from the top of the stack to the bottom and then&nbsp;performs a cd to the new top directory. A negative argument (-N) shifts directories in the opposite direction, from the bottom to the top, before performing the cd.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs\n/etc/ssl/certs ~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html\n/etc/apache2\n$ pushd +1\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src /var/www/html /etc/apache2\n/etc/ssl/certs\n$ pushd +2\n/etc/apache2 /etc/ssl/certs ~/Work/Projects/Web/src\n/var/www/html</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    In this manner, you can jump to any other directory in the stack with a simple command. If your stack is long, however, it may be difficult to judge a directory’s numeric position by eye. So, print the numeric position of each directory with dirs -v, as you did in “View a<br>directory stack”:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs -v\n0 /etc/apache2\n1 /etc/ssl/certs\n2 ~/Work/Projects/Web/src\n3 /var/www/html</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    To shift /var/www/html to the top of the stack (and make it your current directory), run pushd +3. To jump to the directory at the bottom of the stack, run pushd -0&nbsp;(dash zero):\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs\n/etc/apache2 /etc/ssl/certs ~/Work/Projects/Web/src\n/var/www/html\n$ pushd -0\n/var/www/html /etc/apache2 /etc/ssl/certs\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    You also can remove directories from the stack beyond the top directory, using popd with a numeric argument. The command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ popd +N</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    removes the directory in position N from the stack, counting down from the top. A negative argument (-N) counts up from the bottom of the stack instead. Counting begins at zero, so popd +1 removes the second directory from the top:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\" language-bash\"><code>$ dirs\n/var/www/html /etc/apache2 /etc/ssl/certs\n~/Work/Projects/Web/src\n$ popd +1\n/var/www/html /etc/ssl/certs ~/Work/Projects/Web/src\n$ popd +2\n/var/www/html /etc/ssl/certs</code></pre>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    This Post is a summary of the famous Article about Microservices: https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"a-definition-of-this-new-architectural-termlessbrgreater\">\n      a definition of this new architectural term<br>\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text discusses the concept of \"Microservice Architecture,\" which is an approach to designing software applications as a suite of independently deployable services. It highlights that there is no precise definition but outlines common characteristics such as organization around business capabilities, automated deployment, decentralized control of languages and data, and the use of lightweight communication mechanisms like HTTP. Microservices are contrasted with monolithic architecture, where applications are built as a single unit. The text emphasizes that microservices provide advantages like independent deployment, scalability, and modular structure, making it increasingly appealing for building enterprise applications. The microservice style is not claimed to be innovative but is considered beneficial for software development.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"componentization-via-services\">\n      Componentization via Services\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text discusses the evolution of component-based software development in the software industry. It highlights the distinction between libraries and services as components, with a focus on microservice architectures. The main point is that components, in this context, are units of software that are independently replaceable and upgradeable. The text also explains that services, as out-of-process components, offer advantages in terms of independent deployability and explicit component interfaces. However, it acknowledges that using services can have downsides, such as increased overhead for remote calls and challenges in changing the allocation of responsibilities between components. The text concludes by noting that services can consist of multiple processes that are developed and deployed together.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"organized-around-business-capabilities\">\n      Organized around Business Capabilities\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text mentions how companies like comparethemarket.com organize themselves using cross-functional teams responsible for building and operating individual services. The text also touches upon Conway's Law, emphasizing that an organization's system design mirrors its communication structure.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The key point is the contrast between the traditional approach of splitting teams based on technology layers (UI, server-side, database) and the microservices approach, which focuses on dividing services around business capabilities. Microservices encourage cross-functional teams with expertise in user experience, database, and project management. The text suggests that large monolithic applications can also benefit from modularization based on business capabilities but cautions against excessive complexity and recommends maintaining clear team boundaries, which is facilitated by the more explicit separation in service components.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"products-not-projects\">\n      Products not Projects\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text discusses the difference in development approaches between traditional project-based models and the microservices approach. In the traditional model, software development is seen as a project with a defined end, after which it's handed over to a maintenance organization. Microservice proponents advocate for teams to own a product throughout its entire lifecycle, emphasizing the \"you build, you run it\" philosophy popularized by Amazon.<br><br>This approach encourages developers to be responsible for their software in production, fostering closer interaction with how it behaves and its users. The text highlights that this product-oriented mentality aligns with the focus on business capabilities, emphasizing an ongoing relationship where software continuously enhances business capabilities.<br><br>It also notes that while this approach can be applied to monolithic applications, the smaller granularity of services in microservices makes it easier to establish personal relationships between service developers and their users.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"smart-endpoints-and-dumb-pipes\">\n      Smart endpoints and dumb pipes\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text starts by mentioning the traditional approach, exemplified by Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), where significant intelligence is embedded in the communication mechanism itself, allowing for sophisticated message routing, choreography, and transformation.<br><br>In contrast, the microservices community prefers a different approach: \"smart endpoints and dumb pipes.\" Microservices are designed to be highly decoupled and cohesive, with each service owning its domain logic. These services act as filters, receiving requests, applying logic, and producing responses. They utilize simple RESTish protocols and emphasize two common protocols: HTTP request-response with resource APIs and lightweight messaging. The principles of the World Wide Web and Unix underlie these protocols.<br><br>The text also highlights that, in microservices, the infrastructure used for messaging is typically simple and serves as a message router only, with the intelligence residing in the end points. The key challenge in transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices is changing the communication pattern. The text advises against a naive conversion to remote procedure calls (RPC) as it can lead to inefficient and \"chatty\" communications, advocating for a coarser-grained approach instead.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"decentralized-governance\">\n      Decentralized Governance\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text highlights the limitations of centralized governance, such as the tendency to standardize on single technology platforms. In contrast, microservices allow for a more flexible approach, enabling teams to choose the right tools and technologies for specific components.<br><br>Microservice teams focus on producing practical tools and sharing them with other developers, often following open-source practices. This approach encourages flexibility in solving similar problems while still valuing service contracts. The text mentions patterns like Tolerant Reader and Consumer-Driven Contracts that help service contracts evolve independently, with tools enabling automated contract verification during the build process.<br><br>Furthermore, the text discusses the \"build it / run it\" ethos popularized by Amazon, where development teams are responsible for operating the software they build, emphasizing the decentralization of responsibility. This approach, exemplified by companies like Netflix, fosters a focus on code quality and contrasts sharply with traditional centralized governance models.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"decentralized-data-management\">\n      Decentralized Data Management\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text points out that decentralized data management leads to differences in the conceptual models of systems, particularly when integrating across a large enterprise. This divergence in views can even occur within applications, especially when they are divided into separate components, which can be understood using the concept of Bounded Context from Domain-Driven Design.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Microservices further decentralize data storage decisions by allowing each service to manage its own database, known as Polyglot Persistence. This contrasts with the monolithic approach of a single logical database for persistent data.<br><br>In terms of data updates, traditional monolithic applications often use transactions to guarantee consistency when updating multiple resources. However, microservices prioritize transactionless coordination between services due to the challenges of implementing distributed transactions. This approach acknowledges that consistency may be eventual and addresses problems with compensating operations.<br><br>The text also highlights that managing inconsistencies aligns with business practices where businesses often tolerate a degree of inconsistency to respond quickly to demand, with the ability to reverse processes to address mistakes. This trade-off is considered worthwhile as long as the cost of fixing errors is lower than the cost of lost business under greater consistency.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"infrastructure-automation\">\n      Infrastructure Automation\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text points out that teams building microservices often have experience with Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration, both of which heavily rely on infrastructure automation.<br><br>The text highlights that infrastructure automation plays a crucial role in building confidence in software by running automated tests and automating deployment to different environments. It mentions that once the path to production for a monolithic application is automated, deploying more applications becomes less daunting. The goal of Continuous Delivery is to make deployment a routine and uneventful process.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The text also acknowledges that while the deployment process may not differ significantly between monolithic applications and microservices, the operational landscape for each can be notably distinct, suggesting that infrastructure automation is key to managing microservices effectively in production.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"design-for-failure\">\n      Design for failure\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The text points out that using services as components means applications need to be resilient and capable of handling service failures. Unlike monolithic designs, microservices introduce complexity in managing failures gracefully. To address this, microservice teams place a strong emphasis on monitoring and detecting failures in real-time.<br><br>The text mentions Netflix's \"Simian Army,\" which intentionally induces service and datacenter failures during the working day to test the application's resilience and monitoring capabilities. While monolithic architectures can also have sophisticated monitoring, it's less common.<br><br>Microservices require the ability to quickly detect and, if possible, automatically restore service. They rely on real-time monitoring, checking both architectural and business-relevant metrics. Semantic monitoring helps spot issues, especially in a microservices architecture where choreography and event collaboration can lead to emergent behavior, which may not always be desirable.<br><br>The text concludes that microservice teams expect to have sophisticated monitoring and logging setups for each individual service, including dashboards for status, operational and business metrics, and details on circuit breaker status, throughput, and latency. Transparency and quick detection of failures are critical in a microservices environment.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"evolutionary-design\">\n      Evolutionary Design\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Microservice practitioners often come from an evolutionary design background and view service decomposition as a tool to enable application developers to control changes without slowing down the development process.<br><br>The key principle behind microservices is the notion of independent replacement and upgradeability. This means looking for points in the application where components can be rewritten without affecting their collaborators. Some microservice groups take this a step further by expecting that many services will be replaced rather than evolved in the long term.<br><br>The text provides examples of applications that started as monoliths but evolved in a microservice direction. These microservices are particularly useful for adding temporary features or services that are discarded after a short period, such as specialized pages for sporting events.<br><br>It emphasizes the importance of modular design based on the pattern of change, where components that change together should be in the same module. Microservices allow for more granular release planning, as changes only require redeploying the specific service(s) that were modified. However, this introduces the challenge of ensuring that changes to one service do not break its consumers, and the text suggests that versioning should be a last resort, with services designed to be tolerant of changes in their suppliers.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"are-microservices-the-future\">\n      Are Microservices the Future?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The concept of microservices is a promising architectural style for enterprise applications but the text emphasizes that it's still too early to make definitive judgments about its long-term impact. Several well-known companies, including Amazon, Netflix, The Guardian, and others, have adopted microservices. However, the text acknowledges that the full consequences of architectural decisions may take several years to become evident.<br><br>It highlights some challenges and potential concerns associated with microservices, such as the difficulty of defining service boundaries, the increased complexity in coordinating interface changes, and the risk of moving complexity from within a component to the connections between components. Additionally, the success of microservices can be influenced by team skill, and it remains to be seen how less skillful teams would fare with this approach.<br><br>The text suggests a reasonable argument of starting with a monolith and splitting it into microservices when necessary, while maintaining modularity from the beginning. It concludes with cautious optimism, acknowledging that the microservices style holds promise, but the ultimate outcomes will depend on how well it addresses these challenges in practice.\n  </p>",

The API contracts are written in such a way that can be easily translated into API provider and consumer functionality, and corresponding automated tests.\n  </p>",
