### Overview of GitHub Authentication Methods

When it comes to authenticating with GitHub, there are several methods available, each with its own use cases and
security implications. In this guide, we'll explore the different authentication methods you can use with GitHub and
help you choose the right one for your needs.

GitHub offers three primary authentication methods for accessing its APIs and services:
1. **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: This is the simplest but not the most secure option
2. **OAuth tokens**: Best suitable for applications that need to access GitHub act on behalf of a user
3. **GitHub Apps**: Robust, secure and scalable, ideal for applications that need to interact with multiple repositories

### Comparison of GitHub Authentication Methods

The following table summarizes the key differences between these methods:

| Authentication Method | Pros | Cons |
|-----------------------|------|-------|
| Personal Access Tokens | – Simple to create and use<br>– Quick to get started<br>– Good for personal automation<br>– Can be scoped to multiple organizations<br>– Configurable permissions per token<br>– Admins can revoke organization access<br>– Configurable expiration dates<br>– Work with most GitHub API libraries<br>– No additional infrastructure needed | – Tied to user account lifecycle<br>– Limited to user's permissions<br>– Classic PATs have coarse-grained permissions<br>– Require manual rotation<br>– Browser-based management only<br>– If compromised, expose all accessible organization(s)/repositories |
| OAuth Tokens | – Standard OAuth 2.0 flow<br>– Organization admins control app access<br>– Can act on behalf of multiple users<br>– Excellent for web applications<br>– User-approved permissions<br>– Refresh token mechanism<br>– Widely supported by frameworks<br>– Good for user-facing applications | – Require storing refresh tokens securely<br>– Need server infrastructure<br>– More complex than PATs for simple automation<br>– Still tied to user accounts<br>– Require initial browser authorization<br>– Token management complexity<br>– Potential for scope creep<br>– User revocation affects functionality |
| GitHub Apps | – Act as independent identity<br>– Fine-grained, repository-level permissions<br>– Installation-based access control<br>– Tokens can be scoped down at runtime<br>– Short-lived tokens (1 hour max)<br>– Higher rate limits<br>– Best security model available<br>– No user account dependency<br>– Audit trail for all actions<br>– Can be installed across multiple orgs | – More complex initial setup<br>– Require JWT implementation<br>– May be overkill for simple scenarios<br>– Require understanding of installation concept<br>– Private key management responsibility<br>– More moving parts to maintain<br>– Not all APIs support Apps |

There are two kind of PATs, classic and fine-grained. Classic PATs are still supported but should be avoided if possible
as they have broader permissions and are therefore less secure. If you use classic PATs, you should ensure a short
lifetime and rotate them frequently.
Fine-grained PATs are the recommended option as they provide more granular control over permissions and are more secure.
Fine-grained PATs are not supported by all GitHub APIs, so you should check the documentation for the specific API you
are using.

### Choosing the Right Method

So which method should you choose? It depends on your use case:
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** are suitable for simple automation tasks, personal scripts, or when you need quick access
  to your own repositories. They are easy to set up but should be used with caution due to their broad permissions.
- **OAuth Tokens** are ideal for web applications or services that need to access GitHub on behalf of users. They
  provide a good balance between security and usability, allowing users to grant specific permissions to your
  application.
- **GitHub Apps** are the most secure and flexible option, especially for applications that need to interact with
  multiple repositories or organizations. They provide fine-grained permissions and are designed for long-term use.
  If you are building a more complex application or service that requires robust security, GitHub Apps are the way to go.
